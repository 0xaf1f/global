This is a hodgepodge of various scripts that I use to get through my (phylogenetic) day. 

These scripts are poorly documented, poorly tested, poorly developed, poorly connected, and poorly designed. 

You probably will have lots of trouble using many of them as they might have "outside" dependencies. 

I am hoping to improve this at some point to be better documented, better tested, more organized, and just better. 

Oh, and no, just because some code has all those poor qualities, it doesn't mean it is not useful (that triple negative sentence is poorly phrased too).
